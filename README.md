# lc-qa
LC-QA is a simple web app that allows you to upload documents and ask questions about them. It uses a simple interface built with Streamlit, and it leverages two OpenAI language models to provide a summary of the document and answer the questions asked by the user.

## Usage

To use the app, you can simply run the following command:

```$streamlit run streamlit_ui.py```


This will start the app in your browser. You can then upload documents by clicking on the "Upload files" button on the left sidebar. Once you've uploaded a file, you can ask questions about it by typing them in the text box on the right. The app will then display the summary of the document and the answer to your question.
